# Slack Tableflip

Tableflip is a Slack app. Upon installation your team will receive the
`/tableflip` command which confers upon the invoker the power to overturn
overlords, upend usurpers, invert injustice, and generally flip words upside
down.

The command can be used by itself or accompanied with text. If no text is
specified a table will be provided for you.

### Examples

`/tableflip`<br />
Response: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

`/tableflip mediocre sushi`<br />
Response: (╯°□°）╯︵ ıɥsns ǝɹɔoıpǝɯ

### Help

**Help I can't flip emoji!**<br />
Yep.

**How do I flip emoji?**<br />
You can't flip emoji.

**I don't get a mention when someone flips my username**<br />
What did you do to make them flip you? Think about that before you ask for
help.

### Privacy

Tableflip doesn't request access to your team's data so it doesn't know all the
weird things you talk about. It can't listen to your secret secrets or the
places you like to go for lunch. The only information it receives is the text
you pass it when you run the `/tableflip` command.
